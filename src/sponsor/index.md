# Become a Atrvasa Sponsor {#become-a-atrvasa-sponsor}

Atrvasa is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use.
The amount of effort needed to maintain this ecosystem and develop new features for the project is only made sustainable thanks to the generous financial backing of our sponsors.

## How to Sponsor {#how-to-sponsor}

Sponsorships can be done via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/keykhosrow) or [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/atrvasa). Invoices can be obtained via GitHub's payment system. Both monthly-recurring sponsorships and one-time donations are accepted. Recurring sponsorships are entitled to put a logo in placements as specified.

## Sponsoring Atrvasa as a Business {#sponsoring-atrvasa-as-a-business}

Sponsoring Atrvasa gives you exposure to Atrvasa developers through our website and GitHub project READMEs. In addition, supporting OSS improves the reputation of your brand, which is an important asset for any company that interacts with developers.

If you are using Atrvasa to build a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor Atrvasa's development: **it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained.**

## Sponsoring Atrvasa as an Individual {#sponsoring-atrvasa-as-an-individual}

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using Atrvasa, consider donating as a sign of appreciation - like buying us coffee once in a while. Many of our team members accept sponsorships and donations via GitHub Sponsors. Look for the "Sponsor" button on each team member's profile on our [team page](/about/team).

You can also try to convince your employer to sponsor Atrvasa as a business. This may not be easy, but business sponsorships typically make a much larger impact on the sustainability of OSS projects than individual donations, so you will help us much more if you succeed.
