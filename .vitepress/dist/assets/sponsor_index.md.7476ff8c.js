Many of our team members accept sponsorships and donations via GitHub Sponsors. Look for the &quot;Sponsor&quot; button on each team member&#39;s profile on our <a href="/about/team.html">team page</a>.</p><p>You can also try to convince your employer to sponsor Atrvasa as a business. This may not be easy, but business sponsorships typically make a much larger impact on the sustainability of OSS projects than individual donations, so you will help us much more if you succeed.</p>',10)];const i=a(r,[["render",function(a,o,n,r,i,p){return s(),e("div",null,t)}]]);export{n as __pageData,i as default};
